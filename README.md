Peer Assessment Project for coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course

This repository contains:
* this README
* CodeBook.md Explanation of dataset
* run_script.R   R Script that produces a final tidy data set.

The raw data used in this project represents summary statistics of linear acceleration and angular velocity measurements, each in 3 different directions, as recorded at 50Hz by a Samsung Galaxy SII smartphone worn on the waist. Apparently this device has an 'embedded accelerometer and gyroscope' which can record these numbers. The original raw data was collected, analysed and published by Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz.
